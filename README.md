# Product Recommendation System using xDeepFM

This project is a demonstration of a product recommendation system built using the xDeepFM model. The recommendation system is integrated into a simple e-commerce site developed using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase how machine learning techniques can be leveraged to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior.

### Key Components

- **xDeepFM Model**: Developed and trained using the provided Jupyter Notebook files (`amazon_rating_T4_linear.ipynb`).
- **Flask Backend**: Provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, product recommendations, and metadata retrieval.
- **React Frontend**: Implements the user interface for the e-commerce site and interacts with the Flask backend for recommendations and user data.
